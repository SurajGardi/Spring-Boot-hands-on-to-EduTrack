# Spring Boot Hands-On to EduTrack 🚀

This repository follows a **progressive, hands-on learning approach** to mastering Spring Boot.
Instead of building a single large project directly, the repository contains **multiple
standalone mini-projects**, each focusing on one important Spring Boot concept.

All these projects are gradually combined and refined to build a real-world application
called **EduTrack – Classroom & Student Management Portal**.

---

## 📌 Learning Approach

- Each folder represents **one hands-on milestone**
- Concepts are learned **practically**, not just theoretically
- The same application evolves step-by-step into a **complete system**
- Designed from a **placement & interview perspective**
